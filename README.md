# akkaLearning
Code snippets created while learning Akka framework

This repository contains tests that were inspired by the Akka in action book. 

Most of the material discussed in subsequent chapters of the book is covered with simplified test.
This is however, in no way, an excessive approach to test Akka framework. The only purpose of this repository is to turn the teory into practice, and to, hopefully, have a starting point for future reference.

Work in progress.
